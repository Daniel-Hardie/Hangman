# Hangman

This was a project I created during year 12 of high school and was my very first Python 3 project. This project was aimed at showcasing my understanding of how to use many functions to increase cohesion in programming, as well as using iterative structures.

This project includes my first attempts at Pseudo code for planning, version control for the Hangman game and also a test case to ensure comprehensive testing of my program.

The specifications for this game include the user picking to play between 1 and 3 games of hangman, where they can only guess one valid letter per turn. If they get a letter correct, an underscore(s) is turned into the correct letter. If the user cannot guess the word within eight guesses, they lose. The list of words to guess is hardcoded into the program.
